## Overview
The **Adventure Quest Game** is an interactive text-based game where players make decisions at various stages of an adventure. The outcome of each decision is influenced by probabilities, which are modeled using a Markov Network. Players' choices lead to different outcomes in the story, offering a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience.

## Features
- Dynamic story progression based on player decisions.
- Markov Network-based decision-making system.
- Multiple decision points with varying probabilities of success or failure.
- Randomized outcomes to make each playthrough unique.
